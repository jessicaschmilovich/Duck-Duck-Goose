# Duck-Duck-Goose
Duck Duck Goose simulates the classic game by selecting one player as the goose to be chased each round. Players are stored in a circular doubly linked list, and a random picker determines the goose using a randomly generated move count and direction. The goose can also be super goose, capable of chasing multiple players. This was a school project.
